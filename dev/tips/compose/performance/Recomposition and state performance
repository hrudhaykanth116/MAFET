* Prefer lambda modifiers when using frequently changing state.
* No need to recompose if only need to relayout.

* Gap buffer is used for composable functions.
    * https://youtu.be/Q9MtlmmN4Q0?t=1183
    * Insert, edit, delete is ok but moving gap is expensive i.e ui structural change is expensive.

* Restartable. Serves as scope where recomposition starts.
* Skippable. Skipped if parameters values didnt change.
    * Types:
        * Immutable. val
        * Stable. Mutable but compose runtime will be notified when any public properties change.
        * Unstable. List, set, map are unstable always. Use ImmutableList. Causing recomposition always. marks composable as nonSkippable.
    * @Immutable or @Stable marks a data class stable which has inner dependency on external module data class.
    * Not every function needs to be skip-able. Only if seen performance issues.

* Immutable: Nothing in this object ever changes. If changes need to be applied, new reference will be passed.
data class User(var name: String, val age: Int, val list: List<String>) // not immutable technically but if marked @Immutable, compose runtime will consider it immutable and recomposes only if reference changes.

* Stable: Contents are mutable but changes will be notified to compose runtime. If new changes need to be applied, contents need to be compared by compose runtime.
data class User(val age: Int, val list: List<String>) // not immutable technically(since list could arrayList) but if marked @Stable, compose runtime will consider it stable and recomposes only if properties change.

* Handling unstable classes:
    * Use wrapper around(constructor) external class and mark it immutable.
    * Instead of the whole class, just pass field of the class.
    * Use own class mapper to convert unstable to stable.
    * lists, sets and maps are unstable. consider immutable lists.

* derivedStateOf{}. when your state or key is changing more than you want to update your UI.
    * Distinct until changed.
    * submitEnabled = derivedStateOf{ isValid() }. Button(submitEnabled) is recomposed only when value changes i.e distinct.
* remember(key){}. State needs to change as much as key is changing.
    * remember(key1, key2){ expensive(key1, key2) } remembers the expensive value.

//// Common recomposition prevention (not needed unless performance impacted.) /////

* Lambdas as compose function params are considered unstable in GENERAL.
    * Use viewModel::onEvent instead of lambda i.e { viewModel.onEvent() }
    * Remember the lambdas so they are considered stable.
    * Accessing outer scope variable care unstable lambdas. Fix: Changing/setting the stable remember variable inside lambda i.e { newValue -> stableRememberedFiled = newValue }

* Column, Row and box are inlined. Wrap them in another container to reduce scope.

* Use NonRestartableComposable annotations
