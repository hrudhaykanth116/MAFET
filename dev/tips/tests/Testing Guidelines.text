1. Always INJECT DISPATCHER IN VIEWMODEL so that there wont be dispatcher issues in tests and any dispatcher can be injected that wont block the tests.
2. Use FAKE repositories and services to isolate the unit being tested.
3. Use MOCKING frameworks like Moq or NSubstitute to create mock objects for dependencies when tests intermediate and miscellaneous layers.
4. DO NOT FETCH DATA IN INIT BLOCK of viewmodel as it will make it hard to test the viewmodel. Instead use a separate method to fetch data and call that method from init block. This way you can test the viewmodel without fetching data.
6. Use Rules to set up common test scenerios before and after each test. Use inbuilt ones like TemporaryFolder, InstantTaskExecutorRule etc.
